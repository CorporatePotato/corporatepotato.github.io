      "title": "Distinctive Flap-Style Movement",
      "text": "Master movement in this unique twist on the genre. You control a mouse that flaps its ears left or right — flap rapidly to gain height or slowly to descend. You can also dash sideways to dodge tricky projectiles. This elegant control scheme is easy to learn, yet offers expressive, skillful movement."

    {
      "title": "Intense Bullet Hell",
      "text": "Fight increasingly difficult enemy waves, each unique and with a different attack. You’ll be on the edge of your seat through 30 distinct waves across three levels. Every encounter is tense, unpredictable, and packed with action."
    },
    {
      "title": "A Variety of Upgrades",
      "text": "Collect coins from defeated enemies to upgrade 24 different properties and unique abilities called “Wishes.” These include powerful new weapons, economic effects, weapon modifiers, stat boosts, and more, fueling a strong progression curve."

    {
      "title": "Epic Boss Battles",
      "text": "Conquer huge bosses at the end of each level. With layered attack patterns and multiple phases, these extended battles deliver a distinct challenge beyond regular enemy waves."

    {
      "title": "Immense Power Trip",
      "text": "When defeated, you lose your coins and restart from the beginning of the level, but keep your acquired Wishes. This makes you more powerful each time you begin a new run, creating a thrilling sense of exponential domination."
